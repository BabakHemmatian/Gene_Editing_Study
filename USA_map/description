averagetopic.py generates the average state value for each topic individually, setting a state to a null value if there are fewer than 50 relevant comments.

poolclusters.py generates the average state value across a cluster.

map.py reads in the text files generated by averagetopic.py and poolclusters.py to create the map.

Additionally, num_comments.py counts the number of comments from each state and the num boolean indicates whether or not to generate the corresponding map.
